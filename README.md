# Welcome

Dear Applicant,

Congrats on making it this far! As a next step, we would like to invite you to answer some questions about your Python, Statistics and Probability skills before the interview in order to make sure that you meet the baseline technical requirements for the course. Having candidates which meet this criteria is essential in order for us to deliver on the promise of helping you get a technical job in the AI Field after the bootcamp finishes.

**If you don't know how to solve this:**
Don't worry! We love hungry people. So here are some resources to learn. Feel free to crunch through them and then, come back to the test to complete it!

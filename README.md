# Welcome

Dear Applicant,

Congrats on making it this far! As a next step,  we would like to invite you to answer some technical questions before the interview to make sure that you meet the technical requirements for the course. Having candidates who meet these criteria is essential for us to deliver on the promise of helping you get a technical job in the AI Field after the program finishes.

At Strive School we believe in giving everyone an equal chance to succeed.And yet, it is entirely possible that you find some of the notebook exercises confusing or that you don't know how to code in a **Jupyter notebook or even Python**. Our goal is to **select individuals with high potential** to further empower your knowledge and likelihood of getting a job. Note that this doesn't mean high potential individuals who already know how to do the exercises. Our hopes here are that if you are motivated enough, you also go through the process of learning how to answer such questions even if you did not know python beforehand. We want to develop exceptional data scientists from unconventional places and backgrounds.

# What you need in order to complete the exercises

Here are the most fundamental resources that you will need to learn Python, statistics and complete our Jupyter notebook:
- [Python Kaggle Course](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python)
- [Crash Course on Statistics and Probability](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyddY7DlV58)
- Installing Anaconda on [Ubuntu](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-anaconda-on-ubuntu-18-04-quickstart) | [Mac](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/mac-os/) | [Windows](https://problemsolvingwithpython.com/01-Orientation/01.03-Installing-Anaconda-on-Windows/)
- [Running a Jupyter notebook from Anaconda](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/execute.html)
- Or, if you want to code in Python, [How to convert a Jupyter Notebook into a .py file](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37797709/convert-json-ipython-notebook-ipynb-to-py-file)

**Difference between a Jupyter Notebook and Python**
While Python is a programming language that you may already be familiar with, Jupyter notebook provides us for a sequential way of executing cells (containing python code), which is quite useful for Machine Learning since it is normally a repeatable process.
